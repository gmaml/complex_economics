    "section": "Money",
    "text": "Money\nA fundamental axiom of complexity economics is fundamental uncertainty. This concept has a long history in economics, with Keynes being one of its prominent supporters. As John Maynard Keynes described this in 1937, “the prospect of a European war, the rate of interest twenty years hence … About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know.”\nWe can easily grasp this axiom: for instance, we don’t know exactly how the recent AI revolution will impact our society. Keynes invoked fundamental uncertainty to build a monetary theory of production [9] in modern economies, demonstrating why money is important and not merely a veil.\n“The theory which I desiderate would deal, in contradistinction to this, with an economy in which money plays a part of its own and affects motives and decisions and is, in short, one of the operative factors in the situation, so that the course of events cannot be predicted, either in the long period or in the short, without a knowledge of the behaviour of money between the first state and the last. And it is this which we ought to mean when we speak of a monetary economy.”\nSignificant efforts have been made to theorize Keynes’ insights, leading to various schools of thought: mainstream neoclassical, New Keynesians and different flavors of post-Keynesian. Summarizing the status of each school, their evolution, and interactions is beyond our scope here, but references are provided for further exploration.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that money-related problems have emerged periodically in recent decades,1 culminating in the severe 2008 financial crisis. This event inspired voluminous research investigating its causes, all elucidating the importance of money in the economy.[10], [11], [12], [13] For example, Mehrling’s “money view” [13], [14] showed the hierarchy of money and how specific economic agents maintain these hierarchies. The relationships between money at different hierarchies are called parities. The breakdown of these parities can cause violent disruptions in economic activities.\nAnother notable example comes from King[15], a former governor of the Bank of England during the financial crisis, who emphasized radical uncertainty, which is essentially the same as fundamental uncertainty, is the most significant obstacle faced by central bankers to set monetary policies.\nComplexity economics has acknowledged fundamental uncertainty as a first principle from its inception. Indeed, it’s of utmost importance to complexity economics in arguing for bounded rationality or non-defining rationality. The first complex economic models used these principles to study stock markets. Money, such as bank deposits are so stable that no further considerations are needed. With the hindsight from financial crisis, I believe that money is also a consequence of fundamental uncertainty. Complexity economics provides a useful framework to unite various strands of thought about money into a coherent system.\nAt the risk of oversimplification, money or demand deposits are liabilities issued by banks, supported by loan portfolios and bank equity. Money is accepted as the only universal payment method, while loans are IOUs from private borrowers to banks. This is typically called credit transformation. Another important feature of money is “the use of money must be so regulated as to give no privilege of seigniorage to any agent”[16]. In general, currency is issued by central banks and its central banks’ responsibility to maintain parity between currency and bank deposit. Nevertheless, banks and its regulator, central bank, all face the fundamental uncertainty when they issue loans and regulating financial systems, complexity economics is a natural choice to understand their behaviors.\nDue to space limitations, we’ve only scratched the surface of money issues in complexity economics. Other important topics include how shadow banking grows from and symbiotically relates to the banking system, how interest rates work, how money relates to capital markets, and how money affects inflation and the real economy. While these topics have been extensively explored within other frameworks, I believe complexity economics potentially offers a more comprehensive understanding of these very important and complex issues."

    "text": "AI developments\nComplexity sciences, as a multidisciplinary field, have been inspired by AI research since their inception. For example, Herbert Simon’s concept of bounded rationality and John Holland’s genetic algorithms have been extensively used in complexity economics. Following this historical pattern, it is natural to expect that recent developments in AI will affect complexity economics at various levels.\nOne major recent development in AI is deep learning[17], [18], [19], [20], a type of machine learning models which achieve great performance using with large training datasets. These advancements are accompanied by improvements in computer hardware and software to manage and process large datasets. Complexity economics will undoubtedly benefit from such developments as it evolves to create higher-fidelity economic simulation models. Among deep learning models, deep graph neural networks are especially promising, as they can help complexity economics better understand complex network dynamics, another salient feature of complexity economics models.\nDespite deep learning’s remarkable success in natural language processing, text analysis, image recognition, and video processing, it faces several significant challenges. These include difficulties in adapting to new tasks, lack of robustness to unforeseen data, requirements for large training datasets, and limited causal understanding.\nProbabilistic machine learning, another strand of AI research [21], [22], aims to address some of these limitations. However, these models still require technical breakthroughs to efficiently process large amounts of data.\nUnderstanding causality is a crucial aspect of scientific discovery. In recent decades, causality has been systematically studied through multidisciplinary efforts spanning AI/machine learning, statistics, and economics [23], [24], [25]. Monetary policy serves as a prime example of how policymakers intervene in a system to enhance its performance. Complexity economics has the potential to incorporate these advancements into its toolbox, leading to more robust economic models.\nNew AI research paradigms have also emerged from other disciplines, such as cognitive sciences. Complexity economics may benefit from such research by integrating insights to construct more realistic agent models. These developments in AI offer exciting possibilities for advancing complexity economics, potentially leading to more sophisticated and accurate representations of economic agent behaviors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Capital investment is typically funded through two primary avenues: long-term savings and money market instruments. The long-term savings approach often involves institutional investors, such as pension funds, directly purchasing equity and debt instruments. This approach taps into the capital accumulated through long-term savings and investment horizons.\nIn contrast, the money market instrument approach relies on shorter-term, more liquid vehicles like commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and money market funds. These instruments are continuously rolled over, providing a potentially cheaper source of funding compared to long-term savings.\nHowever, the money market instrument approach also introduces additional risks to the financial system. These “shadow banking” instruments, which include everything except traditional bank deposits, operate outside the traditional banking regulatory framework. This creates potential vulnerabilities, as shadow banking activities can destabilize the broader financial system if not properly monitored and managed.\nDespite the convenience that shadow banking instruments provide for capital investment, their growth and behavior are inextricably linked to the policies and regulations governing the traditional banking sector. Furthermore, central bank monetary policies can have significant impacts on the dynamics of both the banking and shadow banking systems.\nIn this article, we will use sample transactions to clarify the differences among various funding avenues and pinpoint the exact risk sources. To keep the presentation focused, we will not delve into how central bank policies may affect these funding operations, but rather concentrate on the inherent trade-offs and risks associated with long-term savings and money market instruments."

    "text": "Case 1: capital investments by long term saving\nIn the first case, the long-term savings funding model, the firm issues bonds to raise capital for the purchase of capital goods. This setup aligns with the standard asset pricing literature frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccounts_1\n\n  \n\nfirm_account\n\nFirm  Asset Liability  Investment 100   Bond 100      \n\nhousehold_account\n\nHousehold  Asset Liability  Bond 100         \n\nbank_account\n\nBank  Asset Liability         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first case focusing on long-term savings funding, it may be misleading to suggest that the banking sector has no activity. According to the “money view” perspective outlined by Perry (2022), there is a critical role for “primary money” as the method of payment, rather than just bond transactions alone.\nSpecifically, households would likely need access to money, in the form of bank deposits, in order to purchase the bonds issued by the firm. Similarly, the firm would require money to make payments to workers and to fund the capital investment. Therefore, the economy would rely on the banking system to provide loans that facilitate these necessary transactions and enable the flow of funds.\nAs Perry (2022) explains, these bank loans represent a “flux and reflux of credit” that are ultimately paid off, leaving no residual bank deposits in the economy. We can further imagine how the balance sheets would change after the capital investment is made. There are two possibilities:\n\nIf the investment generates $10 in profits over the year, the firm could choose to pay $10 in interest to the household. This would still require the banking system to issue the money to facilitate the interest payment.\nIf the investment loses $10 in value over the year, the bond value would decrease by the same amount. However, this loss of investment value would not necessarily lead to instability in the broader financial system."

    "text": "Case 2: capital investment by bank loan\nIn the second case, where bank deposits are used to fund the capital investments, the banking sector plays a more active role. The bank will expand its balance sheet by making a loan to the firm to facilitate the investment.\nThe resulting balance sheets would be as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccounts_2\n\n  \n\nfirm_account\n\nFirm  Asset Liability  Deposit +100   Loan +100  Deposit -100     Investment +100           \n\nhousehold_account\n\nHousehold  Asset Liability  Deposit +100                     \n\nbank_account\n\nBank  Asset Liability  Loan +100   Deposit +100                  \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to Case 1, we will omit the explicit creation of money by the bank to facilitate transactions, in order to maintain clarity.\nIn this second case, we demonstrate that the firm obtains a loan from the bank, thereby acquiring a bank deposit. The firm then uses this deposit to pay the household for the inputs required to produce the investment goods. At the end of the day, the household holds the bank deposit as an asset.\nThis process can be viewed from both the bank’s and the household’s perspectives. From the bank’s viewpoint, it has expanded its balance sheet by creating the loan, and the household now holds the resulting deposit to fund the investment. Alternatively, the household has chosen to hold its savings in the form of a bank deposit, and the bank has utilized this deposit to finance the firm’s investment.\nThe key difference between Case 2 (bank deposit funding) and Case 1 (long-term savings funding) is that in Case 2, the money, in the form of the household’s bank deposit, remains in the economy after the settlement process, rather than being extinguished as in Case 1.\nTo understand why this is the case, consider what would happen if the bank were to withdraw the loan. In order to repay the loan, the firm would need to sell the investment goods back to the household to obtain the necessary funds. This highlights the fact that the bank loan in Case 2 is, for simplicity, an unsecured loan.\nCompared to the bond investment in Case 1, the bank loan in Case 2 may be a cheaper source of financing for the firm. However, this approach also introduces its own risks, including the potential for interbank risk.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have aggregated all households into a single entity and all banks into a single bank. In reality, the deposit held by the household may not be with the same bank that provided the loan to the firm. Therefore, the interbank network would need to facilitate the flow of the household’s deposit to the bank that made the loan. In modern times, the central bank plays an important role in enabling such interbank activities if direct lending between banks were to falter.\nIn the real world, both bank loans and bond financing are utilized to fund a diverse range of investments. For the purposes of this analysis, we have aggregated these heterogeneous investment activities into a single “investment” category. Some investments may be more suitable for bank loan financing, while others may be better suited for bond financing. Maintaining the appropriate discipline and balance between these funding sources is an important consideration."

    "section": "Case 3: Capital Investment Funded by Repo",
    "text": "Case 3: Capital Investment Funded by Repo\nThe previous two cases (Case 1 and Case 2) focused solely on the traditional banking system. Now, we will consider the role of shadow banking, specifically the use of repurchase agreements (repos) to finance the firm’s capital investment.\nThe motivation behind this case is as follows: The firm issues new bonds to finance an investment. In the earlier Case 1, the household had purchased some of these bonds. Now, the household would like to use those bonds as collateral to obtain short-term funding through a repo transaction.\nThe key function of the repo is to transform the household’s long-term bond holdings back into a more liquid, short-term bank deposit-like asset. This allows the household to continue holding the newly issued bonds while also obtaining the necessary funding for the firm’s investment.\nWe will examine two sub-cases to understand how the household can engage in the repo transaction:\nRepo with a bank Repo with a money market mutual fund In the first sub-case, the household would conduct the repo directly with a bank. In the second sub-case, the household would use a money market mutual fund as the counterparty for the repo transaction.\n\nCase 3.1 repo from a bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccounts_3_1\n\n  \n\nfirm_account\n\nFirm  Asset Liability  Investment2 +50   bond2 +50                        \n\nhousehold_account\n\nHousehold  Asset Liability  ① Deposit +50   repo +50   ② Deposit -50     ② Bond2 +50      ③ Deposit +50            \n\nbank_account\n\nBank  Asset Liability  repo +50   Deposit +50                        \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first sub-case of Case 3, where the household uses a repo transaction with a bank to finance the capital investment, the steps would be as follows:\n\nThe household obtains a deposit from the bank through the repo transaction, using the previously held bonds as collateral.\nThe household then uses this deposit to purchase the newly issued bonds (Bond2) from the firm.\nFinally, the firm uses the proceeds from selling the bonds to pay the household for the investment inputs (Investment2).\n\nCompared to Case 1 (long-term savings funding) and Case 2 (bank deposit funding), Case 3.1 can be viewed as a combination of the two. The key difference is that the repo loan is secured by the household’s bond holdings, rather than being an unsecured loan as in Case 2.\nUpon closer examination of the balance sheets, it may appear tempting to simply cancel out the repo loan between the bank and the household, effectively collapsing Case 3.1.1 back to the baseline Case 1 scenario. This could suggest that the repo transaction is just facilitating the long-term funding of the capital investment and does not introduce any additional risks to the financial system.\nHowever, this interpretation would be flawed due to the oversimplified single-household assumption in the model. In the real world, the household using the repo to finance the investment would likely be different from the household holding the deposit that ultimately funds the investment.\nThis means that the repo holder (the household obtaining the short-term funding) would constantly need access to the deposits held by other households in order to maintain the funding for the capital investment. This dynamic is analogous to the interbank risk highlighted in Case 2, where the flow of funds between different banks was a critical consideration.\n\n\nCase 3.2: Repo Funding from a Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF)\nIn this sub-case, rather than obtaining the deposit through a repo transaction with a bank, the household instead obtains the deposit from a money market mutual fund (MMMF).\nMMFs essentially transforms bank deposits into short-term, highly liquid MMMF shares. The following MMMF balance sheet shows the transformation and how it provides repo loans:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccounts_3_2\n\n  \n\nmmmf_account\n\nMMMF  Asset Liability  Deposit +50   MMMF share +50  Deposit -50     repo +50          \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous Case 3.2.1, in this scenario the household uses MMMF shares to finance the repo transaction. However, it’s important to note that the underlying funding for the MMMF shares is still bank deposits. Since MMFs do not have the ability to create their own deposits, they must obtain them from other agents within the financial system.\nThis introduces an extra layer of interconnectedness and potential risk. Not only is there the risk of interbank contagion as highlighted in Case 2, but there is also the risk of the MMMF itself collapsing. If the MMMF were to experience distress, it would need to sell its assets (likely the repo loan to the household) in order to meet its obligations to the household and other investors holding MMMF shares.\nThis highlights a key difference between bank-based repo financing (Case 3.1) and MMMF-based repo financing (Case 3.2). In the former, the risk is more contained within the traditional banking sector, while in the latter, the collapse of the MMMF can have broader systemic implications by transmitting stress through the shadow banking system.\nFinally, let’s compare Case 2 (bank loan financing) and Case 3 (repo financing). A key distinction is that repo financing tends to connect the risks of the collateral used in the transaction with the risks of the underlying investment being funded.\nIn contrast, traditional bank loan financing does not necessarily create this direct linkage between the collateral and the investment.\nTo illustrate this point, consider the example of mortgage financing. If a mortgage is financed through a traditional bank loan, the failure of the mortgage may not directly affect the value of unrelated assets, such as Treasury securities, that are not directly connected to the mortgage.\nHowever, if the same mortgage is financed through a repo transaction, the risks of the mortgage are now more closely coupled with the risks of the Treasury securities (or other assets) used as collateral for the repo. This means that any stress or losses associated with the mortgage could potentially transmit to the collateral assets, leading to broader contagion effects across the financial system."

    "text": "Case 4: Capital Investment Funded by Eurodollars and FX Swaps\nBuilding upon the previous analysis, we can extend our examination of capital investment funding sources to include global, dollar-denominated instruments - specifically, Eurodollars and foreign exchange (FX) swaps.\nEurodollars refer to dollar-denominated deposits held in banks outside of the United States, including the foreign branches of U.S. banks. In many ways, Eurodollars function similarly to traditional bank deposits in terms of providing funding for capital investments.\nThe key difference, however, is that Eurodollars are not subject to the same reserve requirements as domestic bank deposits. This regulatory distinction can potentially introduce additional risks to the financial system, as Eurodollars operate with less oversight from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nThat said, these risks may be somewhat mitigated by broader banking regulations, such as the Basel III framework, which aims to enhance the resilience of the global financial system.\nThe second global funding source we’ll consider is FX swaps. These instruments allow for the transformation of foreign currency loans into dollar-denominated financing for capital investments. Since these foreign currency loans are regulated by other central banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve may have less visibility and control over the associated credit conditions and risks."
